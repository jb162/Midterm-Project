Purpose

In this project, there were comparisons done on various platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+), and their movie offerings. The significance of this project is that 
customers and investors alike could use this data to make better decisions. Customers can use this data to find the platform with the best offerings and investors can use 
this data to have better movie offerings than their competitors.


Analysis 

1. Which streaming platform offers recent movies?
2. Which streaming platform offers the highest number of movies?
3. Which streaming platform provides movies with better Rotten Tomatoes scores?

Cleaning

To do the analysis we had to cleanr the data set and remove redundant rows. We used group by and aggreage functions for mean and average to condense the data and review it.


Analysis 1: Movie Release Year

We categorized the movies for each year and used a line chart to see which streaming platform offers the most recent movies.

-We found that the streaming platform that offers the most recent movies is Netflix, followed by Prime Video, Hulu then Disney+.


Anaylsis 2: Movie Quantity 

We grouped the movies based on streaming platform and perfomed a value count to calculate the number of movies. We used a bar chart to show the values.

-We found that Amazon's Prime Video has the hihgest number of movies at 4100, Netflix(3550), Hulu(943) and Disney+(922).


Analysis 3: Movie Rating

In order to asses the movie rating we grouped the streaming platform based on rating and calculated their average rating.

-We found that Hulu has the highest average rating compared to the 4 popular streaming platforms. 


Advanced Analysis

1. How does each plattform perform based on an age and quantity breakdown? 
2. How does each platform perform based on movie rating and movie quantity breakdown?
 

Advanced Analysis 1: Age & Movie Quantity

We used a bar chart to show both the age and movie quantity for each streaming platform.

-We found that the streaming platform that offer the most movies for 18+ is Prime Video, Netflix, and Hulu respectively. Disney+ offers the highest number of movies for all demographics. If customers are looking for family movies or investors want to advertise products that cater more to families they could use Disney +. If it is a group above 18 and they want to watch more adult movies or an investor has a target market of above 18 the they would pick Amazon Prime and second Netflix since this two have a higher number of movies for suited for this specific demographic.

Advanced Anaylsis 2: Movie Rating and Movie Quantity

-We found that Prime Video offers the greatest quantity of movies (4100), but this finding does not take into account the rating of movies. A score of 60% or greater indicates
 a "fresh" status. Only 876/4100 or 21.4% of Prime Video movies meet this criteria. After filtering out movies that did not recive a "Fresh" status via Rotten Tomatoes' 
 Tomatometer, each streaming platforms quantity of movie offerings were recalculated. Prior to this recalculation Prime has the largest quantity of movie offerings. With taking 
 into account movie ratings, Netflix offers the greatest quantity of movies with "Fresh" status.


Conclusion

Through our analysis, we identified that Netflix is the streaming platform with the most recent movies. Amazon Prime offers the largest selection of movies compared to other platforms and Netflix has the highest number of movies rated "Fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes. Therefore based on what we have found depending on what the investors goal is or what a customer's needs are they could choose a specific platform to cater to their needs.
