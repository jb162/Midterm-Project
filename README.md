Advanced Analysis 1: Age & Movie Quantity

-We found that the streaming platform that offer the most movies for 18+ is Prime Video, Netflix, and Hulu respectively. Disney+ offers the highest number of movies for 
 all demographics. 


Advanced Anaylsis 2: Movie Rating and Movie Quantity

-We found that Prime Video offers the greatest quantity of movies (4100), but this finding does not take into account the rating of movies. A score of 60% or greater indicates
 a "fresh" status. Only 876/4100 or 21.4% of Prime Video movies meet this criteria. After filtering out movies that did not recive a "Fresh" status via Rotten Tomatoes' 
 Tomatometer, each streaming platforms quantity of movie offerings were recalculated. Prior to this recalculation Prime has the largest quantity of movie offerings. With taking 
 into account movie ratings, Netflix offers the greatest quantity of movies with "Fresh" status.




Conclusion

Through our analysis, we identified that Netflix is the streaming platform with the most recent movies. Amazon Prime offers the largest selection of movies compared to 
other platforms and Netflix has the highest number of movies rated "Fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes.
